I love aim assist so much, I named my firstborn "Aim" is what some of the gaming nerds may do. We are Angry Nerds and we have made our project on *Aim Assist Trainer* to cater to those nerds.

## *Over View* 
Aim assist is a feature in video games that helps players aim at their targets more easily. The goal of our aim assist project would be to investigate how aim assist works and how it affects gameplay. 


## *Description*
1. *Implemented Target Detection*: First, We created a function that detects targets in the game. This is done using collision detection or other techniques.
1. *Calculated Target Position*: Once a target is detected, we calculated the position of the target relative to the player. This is done using vector math.
1. *Applied Aim Assist*: Applied aim assist to the player's aim by adjusting their reticle to point towards the target's position. We did this by calculating the angle between the player's current aim direction and the target position, then adjusting the player's aim direction accordingly.
1. *Refined Aim Assist*: Tested our aim assist and refined it as needed. It involved adjusting the amount of aim assist applied, the detection range and other parameters.
1. *Added User Interface*: Finally, We have added a user interface element that indicates when aim assist is active and how strong it is.
